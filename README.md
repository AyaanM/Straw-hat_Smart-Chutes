# Straw-hat_Smart-Chutes
Smart Chutes is an automated recycling sorting system that identifies recycled material and separates them into correct categories.

Using sensors and a microcontroller this system detects the type of material and directs the item in the appropriate bin. By automating the process, we reduce contamination and improve recycle efficiency, all while making recycling easier for everyone.
